Develop Guide
=======================================

We prefer a standard development method. To ensure this, this guide explains the development rules and instructions.

Code requirements
---------------------------------------

Source code is hosted at `Github <https://github.com/ertuil/SimQN>`_. Pull requests and issues are welcome.
However, the following requirements need to be met:

1. Python codes and the variable's name should follow `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ standard. An automatic `flake8` check is developed, and all pull requests needs to pass the check.

2. Expose APIs should have a `docstrings` to automatic generate API documents. `docstrings` should follow the `Google Style Python Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#s3.8-comments-and-docstrings>`_.

3. Methods, Classes needs to provide enough tests (using `pytest`), and all tests needs to pass the automatic check in pull requests.

Develop and Compile Instruction
------------------------------------------

SimQN is a Python library for quantum networks evaluation. It requires Python > 3.7.0. WE leverage `setuptools <https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/>`_ to build SimQN:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install setuptools wheel twine
    pip3 install -r requirements

To setup the development environments, the following command install SimQN into the python library so that we can do `import qns`:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 setup.py develop

To compile and build a SimQN package, we can use:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 setup.py bdist_wheel

Now the SimQN package is `qns-<version>-py3-none-any.whl` in `dist` directory. To further install this package, you can use `pip`:

    pip3 install qns-<version>-py3-none-any.whl



Compile API documents
----------------------

We adopt `sphinx` to build our documents, and the first thing is to install it: 

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme sphinx-autobuild

To automatic generate the API documents, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source qns

To build document website, use the command:

.. code-block:: bash
    cd docs
    make html
    
Now, the compiled static website is built. Our documents is hosted on the `gh-pages` branch. Use the following command to publish new documents:


.. code-block:: bash

    git subtree push --prefix docs/build/html origin gh-pages
